# Image-Viewer
A Tkinter-based simple image viewing app. 
It allows you to view images in a specified directory only lol. 
You may click left and right button to slide through images. 
The button goes grey when there's no image left.
There's a label to show how many images there are in the directory and which number imgae it is. 

Honestly it looks like a much more primitive version of the windows XP image viewer but still I added this cause it was my second Tkinter program and I definitely want to improve upon it and make it a whole different app for sure as I go along..
